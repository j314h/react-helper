# Components

> here are very very simple components,  
> we use the "ATOMIC" design but with a variant. Let me explain :

> the atoms are here to manage only the form,  
> the color of the html element, our molecules when  
> they will combine its atoms in order to create a functional element.

> for the atoms the shape is managed in its own css file  
> and the color or size of text for certain elements are managed  
> in the tailwind file. this provides flexibility in the reuse of  
> atoms in different projects, while remaining fully customizable.

> the molecules containing the design properties  
> of the atoms will fully reflect the design system  
> of the current project, this also brings total flexibility.
